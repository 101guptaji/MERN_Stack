/*
use the Object.defineProperty() static method to define or modify the properties of an object. 
Object.defineProperty() accepts three arguments: the object to act on, the property key to be created or modified, and an object containing the descriptor(s) associated with the property being created or modified.

By default, properties created using Object.defineProperty() aren't writable, enumerable, or configurable. 
However, any property you create either as part of the object literal or using dot or bracket notation is writable, enumerable, and configurable.

/*
Object.create() creates a new object using an existing object as its prototype. 
This lets the new object inherit properties and methods from another user-defined object the same way that objects inherit properties from JavaScript's built-in Object prototype. 
When you invoke Object.create() with an object as an argument, it creates an empty object with the passed object as its prototype.

In this example, the new object (greet) uses an object literal (newObj) as its prototype, which itself contains the inherited Object.prototype, resulting in a series of inherited prototypes called the prototype chain.

This chain ends at a null prototype, which has no prototype of its own.
